            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a <strong>quantum physicist</strong> with a deep interest in data-driven systems
                and automation tools. I completed my MPhil at the 
                <a href="https://www.nottingham.edu.my/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Nottingham Malaysia</a>, 
                where my research focused on two-qubit entanglement dynamics in 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_quantum_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open quantum system</a>
                 <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. 
                Currently, I’m working on bifacial solar energy projects, developing robust and reliable data logging 
                systems based on Linux. My primary focus is on the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modbus communication protocol</a>,
                which plays a crucial role in modern <strong>solar technologies</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the short term, my goal is to create a self-contained data logging framework that runs 
                seamlessly on any <strong>Linux distribution</strong> using either Modbus 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCP</a>
                or Modbus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_terminal_unit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTU</a>. 
                The idea is to provide users with an installer and setup script 
                that automatically configures their system, enabling them to start logging data with minimal effort. 
                Users will only need to specify basic serial configurations such as 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baud" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baud rate</a>, stop bit, data bits, 
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parity bit</a> through a 
                simple <strong>JSON</strong> or <strong>YAML</strong> configuration file, while the system handles the rest 
                automatically.

                <h3>Modbus Logger</h3>
                <em>Full details available on my 
                <a href="https://hngjesse.github.io/Modbus_loggers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    This project focuses on developing a robust and customizable data logging system for solar monitoring 
                    applications using the Modbus RTU communication protocol over RS485. It is designed to operate 
                    reliably on Linux-based systems, providing users with a lightweight yet powerful solution for long-term 
                    industrial data acquisition.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The system automatically collects, processes, and stores data from multiple Modbus-enabled devices
                    such as DC meters and inverters with minimal configuration. Users only need to define their device 
                    parameters (baud rate, parity, data bits, and stop bits) in a simple configuration file, while the 
                    script handles all communication, error handling, and logging operations seamlessly.
                </p>

                <h4>Personal anecdote</h4>
                <p>
                    This project was inspired by a real challenge I encountered while assisting my supervisor with 
                    recovering data hidden inside a mini PC used in a solar monitoring setup. The device had originally 
                    been programmed to send data to a server in China, but the server was later shut down, leaving the 
                    locally stored data inaccessible. Several attempts by previous students to extract the data were 
                    unsuccessful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I was assigned the task, I initially found only partial 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(computing)#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">log files</a>
                    containing data from a single month, which led me to suspect that older data had been deleted periodically. 
                    Refusing to give up, I requested to borrow the mini PC for three days to perform a deep system analysis. While backing up the 
                    files, I noticed a 22 GB file that couldn’t be transferred to my USB drive due to the 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAT32</a> file size 
                    limit. Its large size immediately drew my attention, it was likely the raw data file. Upon inspection, 
                    the file turned out to be binary and unreadable, so I began researching how to decode it, eventually 
                    succeeding (with the help of ChatGPT) in a single day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After successfully retrieving the data, I realized that the existing software which is developed for an outdated 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows 7</a> 
                    environment, was unreliable for long-term operation. To make the system more robust and 
                    maintainable, I formatted the mini PC and installed 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux</a>, then set 
                    out to rebuild the data logging system from scratch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I discovered that the devices communicated using the Modbus RTU protocol over 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RS485</a>, 
                    so I quickly learned how to handle both the hardware connections and communication parameters such as baud rate, 
                    parity, data bits, and stop bits. Using 
                    <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a>,
                    I was able to read raw register values and decode them into meaningful 
                    physical data. Through analysis, I identified the pattern behind the register structure, some used two 16-bit registers to 
                    store 32-bit integers, while others stored floating-point numbers. Once I cracked that mapping, I successfully 
                    restored full data access and built a new Modbus-based data logging system running on Linux, a more professional 
                    and sustainable solution.

                <h3>Three body simulation</h3>
                <em>Full project available on

                </a></em>


                <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    This project investigates the classical three-body problem, which is a long-standing challenge in celestial 
                    mechanics that studies the motion of three massive bodies under their mutual gravitational attraction. 
                    Unlike the two-body problem, which has an analytical solution, the three-body problem is nonlinear and chaotic, 
                    meaning even small variations in initial conditions can lead to vastly different trajectories. This sensitivity 
                    makes it a rich and fascinating subject in both physics and computational science.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The primary goal of this project is to simulate the motion of three bodies using numerical integration techniques. 
                    The algorithm implemented here is the fifth-order Runge–Kutta method (RK4(5)), known for its balance between 
                    computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. The method was manually constructed using the Butcher Tableau, 
                    allowing for precise control over each stage of integration and providing a strong understanding of how adaptive 
                    step solvers approximate continuous dynamics.

                </div>
                <p>
                    The simulation begins with user-defined initial conditions including the positions, velocities, and masses of the 
                    three bodies, which can be freely modified within the MATLAB code. From there, the system evolves over time through 
                    the iterative application of Newton’s law of universal gravitation. The results are visualized as an animated orbit, 
                    showing the continuous interaction and orbital exchange between the three bodies. The animation highlights key physical 
                    phenomena such as orbital instability, center-of-mass motion, and the emergent patterns that occasionally resemble 
                    periodic orbits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project serves as an example of how complex dynamical systems can be explored using relatively simple numerical 
                    methods. It combines the core principles of computational physics, classical mechanics, and numerical analysis, 
                    providing valuable insight into the unpredictable yet structured behavior of chaotic systems. The approach developed 
                    here can also be extended to study n-body systems, orbital resonance phenomena, or energy exchange mechanisms in 
                    astrophysical contexts.

                <h3>Realistic Football Trajectory Simulation</h3>
                <em>Full project available on
                <a href="https://github.com/hngjesse/Realistic_football_simulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    Realistic Football Simulation Github Page
                </a></em>

                <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    This project numerically simulates the realistic 3D trajectory of a football using the Euler integration method. 
                    The simulation accounts for all key aerodynamic forces acting on the ball such as gravity, drag force, lift (Magnus) 
                    effect, and drag moment to recreate lifelike motion during free kicks, corner kicks, and general play.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Built in MATLAB, the program allows users to specify initial conditions such as launch position, velocity, spin axis, 
                    and lift coefficient. The simulation then visualizes how different spins (around the x, y, or z axes) influence the 
                    flight path, showing phenomena like the famous “banana kick.”
                </p>
                <!-- Insert GIF here -->
                <div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
                    <img src="football_animation.gif" alt="Realistic football simulation" width="500">
                    <p><em>Figure: Numerical simulation of the football using Euler method.</em></p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The model demonstrates the physical realism behind football aerodynamics by coupling Newton’s second law with aerodynamic 
                    equations. The results show how the Magnus effect can cause the ball to swerve mid-air which is an effect exploited by 
                    professional players to curve shots around defensive walls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final visualization includes a 3D-rendered football field where users can watch the simulated trajectory evolve in real 
                    time, revealing how spin direction and air resistance shape the motion. This project highlights the power of computational 
                    physics in connecting mathematics, coding, and real-world phenomena.
